### **Q: Can I make the pipeline run in the background?**

**A. Yes**

Nextflow handles job submissions and supervises the running jobs. The Nextflow process must run until the pipeline is finished.

The Nextflow `-bg` flag launches Nextflow in the background, detached from your terminal so that the workflow does not stop if you log out of your session. The logs are saved to a file.

Alternatively, you can use `screen` / `tmux` or similar tool to create a detached session which you can log back into at a later time.
Some HPC setups also allow you to run nextflow within a cluster job submitted your job scheduler (from where it submits more jobs).

### **Q: The module RECONST_FRF crashed. It can not find a minimum number of voxels to identify as single-fiber voxels in automatic estimation**

<div class="centered">
  <img src={imagefrf.src} alt="screenshot of the FRF module crash" />
</div>

This is an example illustrated a failure of the FRF module caused by an insufficient number of voxels identified as single-fiber voxels during an automatic estimation.
In this case, only 16 voxels were detected.
By default, the minimum required number of voxels is **100** for this pipeline, depending on the resolution or the quality of the data, a higher threshold may be necessary. 

To lower this requirement, you can specify a small value using `--nvox_min=X` option in your command line. 

For this exemple:
`--nvox_min=10`.
